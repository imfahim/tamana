            <p>Tamana’s first foray into technology-based-research was in 2013 with a unique collaboration with Deakin University Australia on TOBY Playpad - a unique, therapist –and-parent designed Early Intervention application for children with Autism. Tamana worked with Deakin on the development of a culturally-adaptive hindi (prototype) version of the early intervention application. Deakin for its work with Tamana, won the Victorian International Education Award for Excellence in International Education – Research Engagement in 2013. </p><br><br>
            <h6 style="color:#7F1F21">IBM Research</h6><br>
            <p>IBM Research: In December 2013, Tamana collaborated with IBM Research & TAUCHI to develop two Kinect based applications targeting retail purchase activities for students with learning disabilities, social development for students with Autism Spectrum Disorder and to provide design guidelines towards whole body gesture-based embodied learning systems. The research was accepted by the prestigious ACM Journal under “Promoting Joint Attention with Computer Supported Collaboration in Children with Autism” on the 17th of August 2015. </p><br><br>

            <p> Based on the success of the research with IBM, Tamana developed a prototype application on the Kinect aimed at enhancing motor coordination, joint attention and cognitive skills of children with autism. The prototype was awarded by NASSCOM at its Social Innovation Forum 2015 for its ICT based social innovation. The goal of the application is also to invite developers in India to work on the Kinect for enhancing cognition and assisting in improving the Fine/Gross motor skills of Individuals with special needs. </p><br><br>
            <h6 style="color:#7F1F21">  Google for Education</h6><br>
            <p> Tamana recently became the first special school to be enrolled in Google for Education in India. Google Apps for Education is a suite of software programs designed for structuring the school structure, academics and curriculum. </p><br><br>
