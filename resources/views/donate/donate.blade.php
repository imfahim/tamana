                Tamana is fortunate to have people of high calibre, repute and exceptional capabilities to grace its Governing Body. These are multi-faceted personalities who are at the peak in their individual professions but who have a deep-rooted love and concern for children with disabilities. They have all been instrumental in the growth of the association and have made significant contribution to the society in more than one way. The achievements of Tamana would not have been possible without the active involvement and support from the concerned and motivated members of the body. <br><br>
