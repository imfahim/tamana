            Nai Disha, as the same name signifies, is a new direction taken by Tamana. Nai Disha was conceived with the realization that the young adults at Tamana have to be equipped with skills to adapt appropriately to the needs of adulthood and thereby function as an independent whole-physically and emotionally. The program aims at creating an infrastructure, which ensures a smooth graduation from school to the outside world, for the young adult and the family. It also aims to ensure training and placements of the young adults in various vocations and organizations. This can either be done independently in the residential center or by associating with various sheltered workshops and training institutions. The vocational training program aims at the following:- <br><br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&#9673;&nbsp;To develop relevant vocational skills and competence among the intellectually and multiply disabled youth to improve their quality of life.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&#9673;&nbsp;To serve intellectually and multiply disabled youth, emphasizing school to career and other career readiness programs in the partnership with the parents, disabled friendly industries and corporate houses.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&#9673;&nbsp;Build awareness about career and employment options for intellectually and multiply disabled individual who face significant barriers to employment; and provide education, training and workplace experiences so they may actively pursue these options.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&#9673;&nbsp;Provide education in the fundamentals of business and economics, the importance of savings, the basics of personal financial management and related consumer issues.<br><br>
            Students are assessed for ability and interest in learning skills for life vocations at Skill Development Centre-Tamana. The areas of training are varied and dynamic and are sometimes introduced to suit the needs of particular students.<br>
						 Besides the vocational training the curriculum also includes formal education through  National Open School  from class 3 to 10, sports and yoga, therapeutic interventions (like speech and occupational therapy), extracurricular activities like music, dance and art and activities of daily living, computer training.<br></p>

										 <h6>Baking</h6><br>
											  <p>Baking (bread, cakes biscuits) is a simple cooking activity and after the process is broken into simple steps (task analysis) like identifying ingredients, weighing the ingredients, mixing, transferring to moulds, baking, decorating, packing and making the bills. Technological advancements have made the process simpler as now state of the art baking equipment are available which are easily operable by a single button and simplest of instructions.  Additionally baked products have a good market in Indian urban areas and are fast moving products. The sales of products help us in raising funds for our organization and providing stipend to students who train in it.  Thus, leading to greater self-sufficiency at student and institutional level. At present there are 12 students working in our bakery unit. A special educator and a baker train these students.<br><br></p></div>

											<div class="col-md-12"><h6>File Making </h6><br>
												  <p>A new vocation has been introduced at Nai Disha Vocational Center -manufacturing Cobra office files. This unit was set up keeping in mind our philosophy of introducing vocations which can easily be learned by our students and the end product has a demand in the market. The fact that the machines are manually operated makes the learning accident free. The file making process has been broken into simple sequences. A core group of 9 students have been selected to make the files. The process of file making involves cutting, creasing, putting rivets, moulding the edges and printing. We hope to cater to the offices, nearby markets and schools. As this unit is simple in its functionality, we hope our young adults may open up a sheltered unit later in life.<br><br>
